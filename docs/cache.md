# Cache

Tapas uses [gitsnapshot](https://github.com/kirillsulim/gitsnapshot) to load tapas index and tapas templates. 
All downloaded data is stored in cache directory defined by [appdirs](https://github.com/ActiveState/appdirs) module.
For exact location of cache directories I would recommend read appdirs documentation.
